# Crowdfunding App Built with Blockchain Technology

This is the final project of team 6 from the Encode Solidity Bootcamp (March 2023)

### Smart Contract Part (Important notes)

- Use "Sepolia" instead of "Goerli" in the project. We can experience transaction failures otherwise. In case you would need its Chain ID: 11155111.

- Web3 Interface to interact with the smart contract: https://thirdweb.com/sepolia/0xA9B981fd48b2A9Dd9075B088d05393d80479b2b0/explorer

- Smart Contract Address: 0xA9B981fd48b2A9Dd9075B088d05393d80479b2b0

- Dotenv: You do not need to add your private key and deploy the smart contract 2nd time because the contract is already deployed. `.env` file has only PRIVATE_KEY constant used to deploy the contract.
